# LeetCode Practice Marathon üèÅ

## Overview
Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice Marathon** repository! This repository is dedicated to improving my problem-solving and algorithmic skills by solving coding challenges from LeetCode. The goal is to maintain consistency in problem-solving by tackling problems daily and tracking my progress. All solutions are organized by the date they were solved, along with the problem's difficulty and topics covered.

## Goals
- Solve at least **one LeetCode problem every day**.
- Enhance my understanding of **data structures** and **algorithms**.
- Track my daily progress and reflect on improvements over time.
- Build solutions in **C++**, with a focus on writing efficient and clean code.

## Structure
Each problem is saved in a folder named after the date it was solved:

```
|-- /MM.DD.YYYY
|    |-- problem_number_problem_name.cpp
```
